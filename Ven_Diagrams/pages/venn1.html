<p align="center">This project visually explains the concept of a single-set Venn diagram, showing the area representing just one set. 
</br>It helps users understand basic set notation and membership using an interactive circle. 
</br>The visualization highlights how elements belong to the set and how the set relates to the universal space. 
</br>It’s a good introduction before moving to multi-set overlap concepts.</p>
